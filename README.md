# RASA
In this project, I have developed a smart travel assistant chatbot using RASA which tells the tourist attraction of European countries.
# Intent
Intent in RASA tells the intention of the user, here, the intention of the user might be to know the tourist attractions of the European countries.
# Entity
Entity tells the type of the object, here the entities are the destinations(Countries) and their tourist attractions.
# Actions
Action in RASA is a task performed by the chatbot that the user asks for. Here the action is to tell the tourist attractions of the countries.\
# Stories
Stories is the conversation between the user and the chatbot where it is used to train a machine learning model to identify entities and intent in the conversation.
# Custom actions
It is a custom code we write to gain the output.
# domain
In domain file, we save the custom action that we create. 

# Conclusion
We can conclude that the travel assistant is developed correctly by training the rasa model.
